# Introduction

The Platform was originally created as a test of knowledge. I have converted as a way to assist others in creating platforms. A basic skeleton.
In addition to this I will be using this project to expand my knowledge, on how to create robust application and platforms that are used by more than one user. 

## Why create this Project

Why not.
