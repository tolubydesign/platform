```bash
npx prisma init
```

âœ” Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma
  You can now open it in your favorite editor.

Next steps:
1. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
2. Set the provider of the datasource block in schema.prisma to match your database: postgresql, mysql, sqlite, sqlserver, mongodb or cockroachdb.
3. Run prisma db pull to turn your database schema into a Prisma schema.
4. Run prisma generate to generate the Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.

Run this command to open up [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio), a simple way to explore and manipulate the data in the database:
```shell
npx prisma studio
```
